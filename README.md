# Data 25 Star Wars Project

## Project Steps:

The character data in your MongoDB database has been pulled from https://swapi.tech/.
As well as 'people', the API has data on starships.
1. Using Python, write code to pull data on all available starships from the API.
2. The "pilots" key contains URLs pointing to the characters who pilot the starship. Use these to replace 'pilots' with a list of ObjectIDs from our characters collection.
3. Insert the starships into their own collection in MongoDB.
(Make sure you drop any existing starships collections.)


## Requirements

- Use good coding principles.  That means testing, appropriate comments, good naming conventions and handling errors gracefully.
- Follow PEP 8
- Create a job board in Trello or similar to keep track of your user stories.  Provide a link to that job board in your version of this README.
- Your code should utilise functional programming OR object-oriented programming
- Use Test Driven Development: write your tests first
- Make sure you commit and push to the remote repo frequently to keep your work up-to-date.
